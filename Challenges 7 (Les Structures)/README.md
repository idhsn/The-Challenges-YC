## 📑 Challenges

### 🔹 Challenge 1: Define and Use a Structure

**Context:** A company wants to manage basic employee information.  
**Task:** Create a `Person` structure with fields `nom`, `prenom`, and `age`. Create a variable of this structure, assign values, and display them formatted.  
🎯 **Goal:** Learn declaration and use of a simple structure.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 2: Structure with Array

**Context:** A school wants to store students' grades.  
**Task:** Create a `Student` structure with `nom`, `prenom`, and an array of integers for grades. Input values and display them.  
🎯 **Goal:** Work with arrays inside structures.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 3: Pass Structure as Argument

**Context:** An application calculates geometric areas.  
**Task:** Define a `Rectangle` structure with `length` and `width`. Write a function that receives this structure and returns its area. Display the area in `main()`.  
🎯 **Goal:** Pass structures as function parameters.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 4: Structure with Pointers

**Context:** A drawing software manipulates 2D points.  
**Task:** Define a `Point` structure with `x` and `y`. Use a pointer to modify its values and display them.  
🎯 **Goal:** Understand pointers with structures.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 5: Structure Returned from Function

**Context:** A digital library manages books.  
**Task:** Define a `Book` structure with `title`, `author`, `year`. Write a function that creates and returns an initialized book, then display its info in `main()`.  
🎯 **Goal:** Return structures from functions.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 6: Array of Structures

**Context:** A supermarket stores product information.  
**Task:** Define a `Product` structure with `name`, `price`, `quantity`. Create an array of products, fill it, and display each product.  
🎯 **Goal:** Work with arrays of structures.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 7: Pointer to Structure

**Context:** A calendar system manipulates dates.  
**Task:** Create a `Date` structure with `day`, `month`, `year`. Use a pointer to assign values and display them.  
🎯 **Goal:** Use pointers to access and modify structure fields.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 8: Structure with Calculation Function

**Context:** A geometry software calculates circle areas.  
**Task:** Create a `Circle` structure with a `radius` field. Write a function that calculates and displays the area using this structure.  
🎯 **Goal:** Associate calculation functions with structures.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 9: Function that Modifies Structure

**Context:** A bank updates customer balances.  
**Task:** Create an `Account` structure with `name` and `balance`. Write a function that adds an amount to the balance and modifies the structure.  
🎯 **Goal:** Modify a structure through a function.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 10: Structure with Dynamic Array

**Context:** A company manages employees dynamically.  
**Task:** Create an `Employee` structure with `name` and `salary`. Use `malloc` to create a dynamic array of employees, assign values, and display them.  
🎯 **Goal:** Combine structures and dynamic memory allocation.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 11: Structure Pointer in Linked List

**Context:** A student management system stores data in a linked list.  
**Task:** Create a `Student` structure with `name`, `grade`, and a pointer to the next node. Write functions to add a student and display the list.  
🎯 **Goal:** Work with structures in linked lists.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 12: Pointer in Structure (Recursive)

**Context:** An application represents binary trees.  
**Task:** Create a `Node` structure with `value`, `left`, and `right`. Build a small tree and display values using pre-order traversal.  
🎯 **Goal:** Implement recursive structures with pointers.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 13: Dynamic Array in Graph Structure

**Context:** A graphics application stores and displays points on a plane.  
**Task:** Define a `Point` structure (`x`, `y`) and a `Graph` structure containing a dynamic array of points. Write functions to add points and display their coordinates.  
🎯 **Goal:** Combine structures, pointers, and dynamic arrays.
