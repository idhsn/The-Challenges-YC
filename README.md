## 📌 About  
This repository contains my very first C programming challenges given to me by my school **YouCode**. They were the starting point of my coding journey, helping me practice the basics of variables, conditions, loops, arrays, functions, and more.  

Each challenge represents a small step in learning and applying fundamental C programming concepts.
